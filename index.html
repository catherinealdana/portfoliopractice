          <h2>about me</h2>
          <p>Back in college when I studied Industrial Design , I did my emphasis in user experience focused on design experiences from art concepts and aesthetics . The goal was to recreate concepts , starting with theoretical research and prototyping living experiences, so users could live and understand the main intention of these concepts. Many years later, I went through customer service experience and industrial processes to get in touch with another kind of user: product users. I realized a UX design certificate could get me an update and approach to virtual product users so I could design a better experience on digital platforms. Ironically , this grasp of studies made me understand my purpose in this field by doing an analysis of how my skills were more adapted to the background of design and closer to building through languages these platforms. My goal now is to learn and challenge myself to dominate what is behind using logic and to become a virtual artisan . </p>
